GPRINTF Version 2.2

This version corrected a problem when accessing fonts under Matlab 6.5.
If Matlab crashes when starting gprintf or you receive an error message,
you need to go to www.themathworks.com and download new versions of
COMCLI.DLL and NEWPROGID.M.  See Solution 33525 for more information.
