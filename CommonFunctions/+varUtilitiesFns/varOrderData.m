function [estY,estX,vname,dates,xtilde]=varOrderData(data,nvar,nlag,varargin)
% PURPOSE: Get right hand side variables and lefthand side variables.
% removes any rows with nans and adjusts any dates acordingly 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Input:
%   data = matrix. (t x n), where t is the number of observations in the
%   sample, and n is the number of variables to be used in the VAR
%   estimation
%
%   nlag = number of lags in VAR 
%
%   nvar = number of variables in VAR
%
%   varargin(optional)
%   'vnames' = string, followed by a cell (1 x n) with the names of the
%   variables in the data matrix, eg {'gdp','inf'}, in the same order as
%   the data in the data matrix
%   
%   'dates' = string, followed by a vector of CS dates (t x n). 
%
%   'constant' = string, followed by a logical. If true constant included
%   in regression. Default=true, else false. 
%
% Output:
%   estY = matrix. (t x n), where t is the number of observations, and n is
%   the number of variables in the VAR
%
%   estX = matrix. (t x m), where t is the number of observations, and m is
%   the number of variables*number of lags + 1 (constant). Note that the
%   ordering of the variables should be according to lags (and not
%   variables), eg y(t-1), y(t-2) etc. 
%
%   vname = cell string. (1,1+n*nlags), with variable names. Matches the
%   ordering of the estX variables. If vnames provided in varargin, these
%   will be used, if not defualts=coeff1..coeffn..
%
%   dates = vector with CS dates. (tt x1), where tt is the length of the
%   estY matrix. If dates provided in varargin these will be truncated and
%   used, if not this will be a be vector of nans
%
%   xtilde = vector, (1 x nvar*nlag + constant). Vector that can be used to 
%   generate forecasts. If constant in model, constant=1, else 0. This will
%   be ordered as ordering in estY and with number of lags provided. See
%   also estX
