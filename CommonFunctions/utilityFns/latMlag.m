function xlag = latMlag(x, p, init)
% latMlag - Generate lags of matrix (vector), following common VAR standards, eg: 
%           x1(t-1) x2(t-1) ... xN(t-1)... x1(t-p)... xN(t-p). 
%   NOTE: This is NOT as done in the Lesage package, which uses x1(t-1) ... 
%   x1(t-p) ... xN(t-1)...xN(t-1)..xN(t-p)
%
% Input:
%   x = matrix or vector, (t x n) where t is number of obs, and n is number
%   of variables.
%
%   p = integer. Number of lags. 
%
%   init = (optional) scalar value to feed initial missing values
%   (default = 0)
%
% Output:
%   xlag = matrix or vector with lags of x. The output has the same size as
%   the input matrix or vector. Missing values at the beginning (due to
%   taking lags) have been replaced by the init argument. 
%
% Usage:
%   xlag = latMlag(x,p,init)
