CNVFINAL03


Purpose:

    To convert input specification files from Version 0.2.10 of
    X-12-ARIMA to a format compatable with Version 0.3 of X-12-ARIMA.

	This utility is a DOS utility - the examples below assume you are
	running the utility within a DOS command window, and are running
	the utility in the same directory that the utility is stored in.


Syntax:

    cnvfinal03 oldspec newspec

    where:

    oldspec is the filename of an input specification file for 
            Version 0.2.10 of X-12-ARIMA;

    newspec is the filename of a input specification file for 
            Version 0.3 of X-12-ARIMA that was formed from the
            specs and arguments found in oldspec.


Note:

    CNVFINAL03 assumes that the input is a valid input specification file
    for Version 0.2.10 of X-12-ARIMA; no attempt is made to verify if
	the contents of the file are in the correct syntax.

    Comments written in the old spec file are not transferred to the
    new.

    Spec names and spec arguments from the old input file are converted
    to lower case in the translated input file.  

    Note that some arguments and tables from Version 0.2.10 of X-12-ARIMA
    are not found in the Version 0.3 of X-12-ARIMA.  Warning messages 
    will be produced when these are encountered.
