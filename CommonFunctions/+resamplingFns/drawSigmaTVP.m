% PURPOSE: Draw stochastic volatility states and the variance of the
% variance. Useing Kim et. al (1998) procedure
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 
% Model: 
% 
% y=Sigma * u  where u ~ N(0,1) and Sigma is a diagonal matrix with std's
% on the diagonal. By squaring terms and taking logs, we get: 
%
% y*=2h(t) + e(t)    where e=log(u^2), h(t)=log(Sigma) and y*=log(y^2)        
% h(t)=h(t-1) + b(t) where the covariance of b(t) is B 
%
% Note 1) that the covariance of e(t) is an identity matrix. This is why we
% can use the Kim et. al. procedure below.  
%
% Note 2) that the y vector should not be on the y* form, but only y. The
% transformation is done within the code, adding an offsetting constant. 
%
% Input:
%
% y = (t x n) matrix with observables (transfomation to logs and adding a
% offsetting constant is done inside the function
%
% sigmadraw = (t x n) matrix with sigmadraw from earlier recursion
% of the function. Used to update draw the s index. Important, these should
% be exp(h(t)), i.e., standard deviation. Inside the code we transform them
% to log variances. 
%
% bdraw = (n x n) matrix with previous draws for covariance of the
% variances. 
%
% h0_mean = (n x 1) vector with a0 values. These should in most cases
% be 0's. 
%
% h0_cov = (n x n) matrix of p0 values. Typically an identity matrix
% scales up by a constant (to make it more diffuse)
%
% vprior = scalar. Degrees of freedom parameter. Used for Wishart
% dirstibution. Must exceed the dimension of the W to make the prior
% proper. 
%
% Sprior = (n x n) matrix. Prior for the (log) variance of the variance. 
%
% Output: 
%
% s = (t x n) matrix with indicators from earlier recursion
% of the function. Used to mix the mixture of draws. Must have elements
% with values in the range 1,2,...7. Updated/sampled from input based on
% simulated values within the function. 
%
% bdraw = new draw of the covariance of the variance. See above
%
% sigmadraw = (t x n) matrix. Draw of state vector, but scaled and 
% transformed such that they are std's, i.e., exp(h(t)). 
%
% Note 3): 
%
% The function only works for the model as specified above. I.e., random
% walk assumption for the volatilities. The y input matrix should be
% transformed appropriately before used as input. 
%
% Usage: 
%
% [sigmadraw,bdraw,s]=drawSigmaTVP(y,sigmadraw,bdraw,h0_mean,h0_cov,vprior,Sprior)
