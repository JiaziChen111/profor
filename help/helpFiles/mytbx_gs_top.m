%% Getting Started

%% Getting Started
% Welcome to the PROFOR toolbox! We hope you find the toolbox enhances your
% productivity as a researcher. 
%
% Getting started with PROFOR is easy. The documentation provided guides the 
% researcher through some simple examples and describes the underlying structure 
% of the toolbox. Click on PROFOR User Guide below, then double click to
% start with the examples. Opt for PROFOR Overview to learn about the
% structure.
%
% After running through these examples, the researcher should adapt the script 
% provided to conduct their own analysis.  The next step -- for the less casual
% researcher -- is to write script and build model classes.  We hope that 
% advanced users will then wish to share their code with other researchers in
% the open source tradition.  Please contact the PROFOR team in this case.
