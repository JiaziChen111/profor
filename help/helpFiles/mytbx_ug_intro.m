%% Introduction 
%
% The PRObability FORecasting (PROFOR) toolbox is part of a research project on
% Probability Forecasting with Macro Variables at Warwick Business School, 
% University of Warwick. The main purpose of the project is to develop, extend 
% and apply procedures to undertake probability forecasting with macro variables. 
% In particular, the toolbox incorporates forecasting models and methods for 
% combining forecasts, together with forecast evaluation metrics. 
% 
% This is a demo version of PROFOR. Subsequent 
% versions will incorporate methods 
% for mixed frequencies, plus non-linear and non-Gaussian processes. 
%
% The demo PROFOR toolbox runs in MATLAB R2014a and R2014b.
%
% By facilitating code and data sharing, the aim is to make the PROFOR toolbox 
% the starting point for graduate researchers and others wishing to learn 
% advanced probability forecasting techniques. 
%
% The PROFOR toolbox, intended as a research tool, provides  
% code useful for researchers wishing to develop a practical 
% forecasting system. Adaptation to this end requires further modifications to 
% the demo version. 
%
% The PROFOR development team are: Shaun Vahey (Warwick), Anthony 
% Garratt (Warwick), Liz Wakerly (Warwick), Craig Thamotheram  (Warwick) 
% and Leif Anders Thorsrud (BI).
