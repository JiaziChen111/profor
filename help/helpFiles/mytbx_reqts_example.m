% The PROFOR Toolbox has been developed and tested running
% both Windows (7) and MAC OS 10.10 machines.
%
% All developments on the toolbox have been conducted on MATLAB versions
% 2014a and 2014b. Older versions of MATLAB might be tricky...

% The PROFOR Toolbox utilizes the Statistics and the Optimization toolboxes
% from MATLAB. The researcher should install these for the PROFOR Toolbox to
% operate without errors.
%
% The PROFOR Toolbox also utilizes the Parallel Computing toolbox from
% MATLAB. If you have this toolbox installed, things will run faster. However,
% the Parallel toolbox is not necessary for operation of the PROFOR Toolbox
