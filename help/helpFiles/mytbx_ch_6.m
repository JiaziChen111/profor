% This section contains examples of how to analyze the results from the
% three different types of outputs.

% # Model - estimation: Estimation
% # Model - estimation: Estimationcombination
% # Profor

%%
% Broadly speaking, these correspond to any of the possible individual
% model types, VAR, BVAR etc that are directly estimated, and the
% combination of these individual model types in Estimationcombination.
% Finally, the recursive evaluation and combination of models can be
% analysed using the results of the Profor experiments.
