%% Evaluating and combining forecasts using PROFOR
% This section contains examples showing how to use and run the Profor
% class itself for estimation and forecasting. Before continuing with these
% examples, read through the sections <./mytbx_ch_1.html Set Up PROFOR>,
% <./mytbx_ch_2.html Process Data> and <./mytbx_ch_3.html Models and

% example files belonging to the PROFOR Toolbox itself. These files and
% data are located in subfolders in the help directory of the toolbox.

% When you run the toolbox on your own data you are advised to save these
% data, the different run files, etc., in a different location.
