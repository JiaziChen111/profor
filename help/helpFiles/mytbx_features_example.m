%% Features of the Demo Version of PROFOR

%% Features
% This demo version of the PROFOR toolbox allows the researcher to generate
% forecasts from time series models estimated by Bayesian and maximum
% likelihood methods with quarterly real-time macro data. The
% models include autoregression, vector autoregressions, plus 
% time-varying parameter and 
% stochastic volatility variants. Subsequent versions of the toolbox will
% utilise higher frequency data and mixed frequencies for macro
% forecasting, with a greater emphasis on non-linear and non-Gaussian
% modelling.
%
% *Forecasts*
%
% Iterative, quarterly, generated from models within PROFOR, or forecast
% densities imported from external sources see external analytic examples
% in the User Guide.
%
% *Combinations*
%
% Equal, averaged logarithmic scores (optimised or not) and Continuous Ranked
% Probability Score weights for Linear (and subsequently) 
% Logarithmic Opinion Pools.
%
% *Evaluations*
%
% RMSPE, Logarithmic scores, Diebold-Mariano type tests, Brier scores and
% decomposition, Continuous Ranked Probablity Scores, Probability Integral
% Transforms (PITS) histograms (plus, one-shot tests of calibration), and
% cost-loss decision-theoretic evaluations.
