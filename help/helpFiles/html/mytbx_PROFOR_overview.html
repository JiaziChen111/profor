%% PROFOR Overview
%
% 
%% Preliminaries - Object Orientated Structure of Program
% A researcher does not need to understand concepts from Object
% Orientated Programming (OOP) to be productive with PROFOR.  Nevertheless,
% OOP concepts are used to treat classes and instances as objects, and their
% 'functions' as methods and class properties, respectively.
%
% To learn a little about OOP  (most code in economics
% is written functionally), take a glance at
% <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming Wikipedia>.
%
%% The PROFOR Toolbox
% The PROFOR toolbox is structured around two fundamental builiding blocks:
%
% # Model: Class to store everything needed to estimate and forecast an
% individual model on a given data set. 
% # Profor: Class that combines and determines how forecasts are 
% evaluated.
% 
% In addition, once all this is done,  a Reporting class  
% allows the user to evaluate forecasts using various methods.
%  
%% Model Class 
%
% A Model class contains all that is needed to estimate a model:
% 
% # Data (Tsdata)
% # Settings (Batch)
% 
% The data have to be converted to PROFOR's data class, Tsdata. This is a
% container for  methods to transform the data. 
% See the
% <./mytbx_ch_2.html Processing Data>
% help for some examples on how this is done. 
% 
% For each individual type of model (e.g. VAR or BVAR), the settings are
% restricted by the Batch class. Thus, the initial set-up of the models is
% restricted to a set of values that make sense to that particular modelling
% class. 
% See the various example batch setups in the 
% <./mytbx_ch_4.html Running Models>,
% and
% <./mytbx_ch_5.html Estimating Models and forecasting>.
%
%%
% <<img/model_with_forecasting.png>>
%%
% Most of the properties of the Tsdata and Batch class can be adjusted by
% the user. 
% Once these two classes are provided and correctly specified, the user
% can estimate the model and generate forecasts. 
% Doing so will populate the estimation and forecasting classes of the Model 
% class.
%%
% In the PROFOR Toolbox, all individual models are initiated and run using the
% Model class container. 
% The specifics of the settings, e.g., the Batch class, might change from 
% one model to the next (e.g., VAR versus BVAR), but they are still run using 
% the Model container. 
%
%%
% <html><h3>Model - State Space Formulation: Link from Tsdata & Batch to 
% Estimation & Forecasting</h3></html>
% 
% The link from initialising the Model class when setting Batch and Tsdata to
% the output of the model estimation and forecasting is achieved by specifying 
% the model in state space.
% 
% The full specification of the state-space system is detailed in
% <../htmlexamples/html/estimationNamingConventionsExample.html Models and Structures>. 
%
% However estimated, all models end up in this format. Thus, aiding the
% combination and comparison of models subsequently. 
%
% From this common state-space formulation a forecast is churned out 
% and stored in the forecast property which is a Forecasting class.
% 
% Within the forecasting class there is a property predictionsY, where all the
% forecasting results are stored in a common Tsdataforecast class. All
% forecasts, are stored with this Tsdataforecast class in order to aid
% comparability. 
% 
%% Profor Class
% The Profor class is simply a wrapper class to perform model evaulation and 
% combination with the ability to take into account the real-time structure of
% data sources. 
% If the researcher supplies the Profor class with real-time data then, in addition to the
% evaluation and combination of models for a given vintage, PROFOR will look to
% the supplied data source, load the nearest data to the requested vintage and
% run model evaluation and combination for this vintage.
% This occurs recursively over the evaulation sample.  
%
%%
% Thus, you can think of the Profor class of doing 2 main things.
%
% # Recursive real-time estimation / forecasting / evaluation.
% # Model combination with recursive real-time estimation / forecasting / 
% evaluation.
%
%% Profor: Real-time capabilities
% 
% The DEMO version of PROFOR  handles quarterly data.  
% Generally, when dealing with real-time quarterly data the current quarter's 
% data are unavailable. 
% Below is a typical real-time data set. 
% It shows data from vintage = V2000.01 - V2000.03. 
% Typically, macro data will contain data with some lag L, as drawn here
% the vintages V2000.01 & V2000.02 have a one-period lag, and V2000.04 has a two-period lag. 
% 
%%
% <<img/RaggedEdge.png>>
% 
% PROFOR can handle the reading of data with ragged edges and will also deal
% with forecasting by generating the required h-step iterative  forecast to 
% achieve the required forecast.
%
%% Profor: Combination
%
% PROFOR also allows for the combination of forecasts. 
% Suppose the researcher has produced forecasts from two models, $(M_1, M_2)$ 
% with a given data vintage, let's say $\bar \tau$. Shown in the figure below, 
% where the estimation sample (for parameter estimation) and the out of sample
% evaluation sample are both specified explicitly. 
% 
%% 
% 
% <<img/timingConventions.png>>
% 
%%
% The combined Model class uses the 
% forecasts produced by $M_1$ and $M_2$ through the evaluation sample, from 
% $\underline{\tau} - \bar \tau$, to construct (out of sample) weights and 
% predictive scores (e.g. average logarithmic score).
% 
%%
% Of course, the weights and scores computed by the combined Model class will
% differ at a given date if the data used to estimate the models are revised.
% Both $M_1$ and $M_2$ need to be estimated for each vintage, and so does 
%  the combined Model class. 
% 
%
%%
% Hence, Profor aims to replicate real-time model estimation and
% combination exercises in a fairly straightforward manner.
% 
%
%% Report Class
%
% Once all estimation, scoring and weighting are done, the researcher will
% want to look at some output!
% This is easy, simply supply the Report class with either individual Model
% classes or Profor classes that have been estimated and used to produce
% forecasts. 
% 
% See the help section on, 
% <./mytbx_ch_6.html To Analyse Results, Construct a Report>, for more
% information.
